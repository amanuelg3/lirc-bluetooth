The project aims to allow users to control various programs on their PC using their cellphone via Bluetooth using customizable J2ME application.

The project consists of 2 components:
  * *btlirc* daemon emulates [http://www.lirc.org/ LIRC] protocol allowing any LIRC-enabled applications (MPlayer, XMMS, etc.) to be remote controlled. If the application don't have LIRC-capabilities, you can use [http://www.lirc.org/html/irexec.html irexec] or [http://www.lirc.org/html/irxevent.html irxevent] to send DCOP messages to KDE applications (Amarok, digiKam, etc.) or even simulating real keyboard key press or release
  * *LIRC Remote* J2ME application connects via Bluetooth to *btlirc* daemon and sends keypress. It is standard MIDP 2.0 application so it shoudl work on any mobile phone with Java and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_APIs_for_Bluetooth JSR 082 support]. It is tested on Nokia 6021 but should work with any Series 40 or Series 60 phone. See [Comapatability] page for more details
